This repo contains all those testing approaches that where considered in the [Unit, integration and functional Testing in Golang (Go)](https://www.udemy.com/course/unit-integration-and-functional-testing-in-golang-go/).

There is a minor comment, after `go1.13+` versions it's most likely you'll encounter an error
when using [golang-restclient](https://github.com/mercadolibre/golang-restclient). In order to fix it
you can use [forked repo](https://github.com/federicoleon/golang-restclient) (at least in this repo it's done so).
